## Who I Am

I'm Andrew Kachnic. I build software, make music, and design interfaces. My time is often spent thinking about silly things like **how to optimize my neovim configuration**, or *why is this thing so slow? could I make it faster/better?*

## What I Care About

I care about people, technology, and the interfaces that bridge the gaps. I'm constantly thinking about how we can improve the experience of working with software. And **I think we can have much better human interfaces than the ones that current exist** and *I want to try to build them*.

### Relationships

In my mind, people and relationships are the best assets you can have. To be able to communicate is gift that tends to go unappreciated. I care about the connections we make, and *how those influence our behavior and each other*.

### Developer Tools

Developer tools hold a special place in my heart- **software for building other software**. I enjoy working on dev-tools because I can dog-food the result and iterate from there.

## My Abilities

If you've made it this far, you might have noticed I haven't listed any specific skills yet. **This is fully intentional.** I'm proficient in TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc... but I care much more about your values than your tech stack. I don't want to work for *\<insert Evil Corporation here\>*, I want to work on something that can reach people and improve the way we interface with the world.
